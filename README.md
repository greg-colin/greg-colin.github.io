Website Performance Optimization

This project consists of a pre-created website, that was in need of optimization,
and optimizations thereto. An animation exists in one page that was nrequired
to run above 60fps.

Optimizations performed:
All images have been optimized for the context in which they appear, and additional
images were created by that process and used instead of the originals.

All JavaScript has either been inlined or minified.



All of the pages have been optimized to the requisite page speeds and animation
frame rate. Let me know if you think I've overlooked something and I'll get it fixed!
