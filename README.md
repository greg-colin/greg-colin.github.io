An RSS Feed reader and a series of tests written using the Jasmine testing framework.

Starting the program (and the test):
Navigate a web browser to: http://greg-colin.github.io

Notes to grader:
All comments in app.js were changed to JSDoc-formatted comments where applicable
One additional test suite has been added to feedread.js to test all feeds in sequence.
NOTE: There is a question in the comments for that new test suite.
